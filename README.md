## Overview

`pymobiledevice3` is a pure python3 implementation for working with iDevices (iPhone, etc...). This means this tool is
both architecture and platform generic and is supported and tested on:

- Windows
- Linux
- macOS

Main features include:

- Device discovery over bonjour
- TCP port forwarding
- Viewing syslog lines (including debug)
- Profile management
- Application management
- File system management (AFC)
- Crash reports management
- Network sniffing (PCAP)
- Firmware update
- Mounting images
- Notification listening and triggering (`notify_post()` api)
- Querying and setting SpringBoard options
- Automating WebInspector features
- DeveloperDiskImage features:
  - Taking screenshots
  - Simulate locations
  - Process management
  - Sniffing KDebug messages (**strace** capabilities++)
  - Process monitoring (`top` like)
  - Accessibility features
  - Sniffing oslog which includes both syslog and signposts
- Backup

## Installation

You can install from PyPi:

```shell
python3 -m pip install -U pymobiledevice3
```

Or install the latest version directly from sources:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:doronz88/pymobiledevice3.git
cd pymobiledevice3
python3 -m pip install -U -e .
```

You can also install auto-completion for all available sub-commands by adding the following into your `~/.zshrc`:

```shell
# python-click<8.0
eval "$(_PYMOBILEDEVICE3_COMPLETE=source_zsh pymobiledevice3)"
# python-click>=8.0
eval "$(_PYMOBILEDEVICE3_COMPLETE=zsh_source pymobiledevice3)"
```

### OpenSSL libraries

Currently, openssl is explicitly required if using on older iOS version (<13).

On macOS:

```shell
brew install openssl
```

On Linux:

```shell
sudo apt install openssl
```

### libusb dependency

Interacting with the device in Recovery or DFU modes requires `libusb` to be installed (necessary for handling the `restore` subcommands).

The installation steps differentiate depending on your exact platform:

On macOS:

```shell
# using homebrew
brew install libusb

# using MacPorts
sudo port install libusb
```

On Linux:

```shell
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev

# Fedora
sudo dnf install libusb-devel

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S libusb
```

On windows:

Following libusb website to download latest release binaries:

<https://libusb.info/>

## Usage

The CLI subcommands are divided roughly by the protocol layer used for interacting in the device. For example, all
features derived from the DeveloperDiskImage will be accessible from the `developer`
subcommand. This also means that every feature which isn't there won't require it.

This is the main CLI usage:

```
Usage: python -m pymobiledevice3 [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

### Working with developer tools (iOS >= 17.0)

> **NOTE:** Currently, this is only officially supported on macOS & Windows (up to iOS 17.3.1), but fully supported on
> all platforms starting at iOS 17.4 using the new lockdown tunnel. For windows interaction with iOS 17.0-17.3.1, you'll
> need to install the additional drivers (we don't provide them)

Starting at iOS 17.0, Apple introduced the new CoreDevice framework to work with iOS devices. This framework relies on
the [RemoteXPC](https://github.com/doronz88/pymobiledevice3/blob/master/misc/RemoteXPC.md) protocol. In order to
communicate with the developer services you'll be required to first
create [trusted tunnel](https://github.com/doronz88/pymobiledevice3/blob/master/misc/RemoteXPC.md#trusted-tunnel) in one
of the two forms:

- Launch a tunnel-server named `tunneld` to automatically detect devices and establish connections
  - Execute the following:

    ```shell
    # if the device supports remote pairing, such as corellium instances or AppleTVs,
    # you'll need to first pair them
    # normal iOS devices don't require this step 
    python3 -m pymobiledevice3 remote pair
    
    # on windows, use a privileged shell
    sudo python3 -m pymobiledevice3 remote tunneld
    ```

- Create tunnel manually using `start-tunnel`
  - Execute the following:

    ```shell
    # if the device supports remote pairing, such as corellium instances or AppleTVs,
    # you'll need to first pair them
    # normal iOS devices don't require this step 
    python3 -m pymobiledevice3 remote pair
    
    # NOTE: on windows, use a privileged shell for the following commands

    # starting at iOS 17.4 you can use the much faster lockdown tunnel
    sudo python3 -m pymobiledevice3 lockdown start-tunnel
    
    # if you need this connection type to be also available over wifi, you can enable it
    python3 -m pymobiledevice3 lockdown wifi-connections on

    # on older iOS version use the following instead
    # you may pass `-t wifi` to force a WiFi tunnel
    sudo python3 -m pymobiledevice3 remote start-tunnel
    ```

    You will be printed with the following output providing you with the required connection details:

    ```
    Interface: utun6
    RSD Address: fd7b:e5b:6f53::1
    RSD Port: 64337
    Use the follow connection option:
    --rsd fd7b:e5b:6f53::1 64337
    ```

_Ths command must be run with high privileges since it creates a new TUN/TAP device which is a high
privilege operation._

Now, (almost) all of pymobiledevice3 accept an additional `--rsd`/`--tunnel` option for connecting to the service over
the tunnel. The `--tunnel` option specifically, is always attempted implicitly upon an `InvalidServiceError` error to
simplify the work with developer services. You can now try to execute any of them as follows:

```shell
# Accessing the DVT services
# The --tunnel option may accept either an empty string, or a UDID for a specific device 
python3 -m pymobiledevice3 developer dvt ls / --tunnel ''

# Or simply without the `--tunnel` option, assuming the tunneld is running
python3 -m pymobiledevice3 developer dvt ls /

# Or we could use the manual tunnel details
python3 -m pymobiledevice3 developer dvt ls / --rsd fd7b:e5b:6f53::1 64337

# And we can also access or the other "normal" lockdown services
python3 -m pymobiledevice3 syslog live --tunnel ''
```

### Commonly used actions
