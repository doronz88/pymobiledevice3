# Description

`pymobiledevice3` is a pure python3 implementation for working with iDevices (iPhone, etc...). This means this tool is
both architecture and platform generic and is supported and tested on:

* Windows
* Linux
* macOS

Main features include:

* Device discovery over bonjour
* TCP port forwarding
* Viewing syslog lines (including debug)
* Profile management
* Application management
* File system management (AFC)
* Crash reports management
* Network sniffing (PCAP)
* Firmware update
* Mounting images
* Notification listening and triggering (`notify_post()` api)
* Querying and setting SpringBoard options
* Automating WebInspector features
* DeveloperDiskImage features:
    * Taking screenshots
    * Simulate locations
    * Process management
    * Sniffing KDebug messages (**strace** capabilities++)
    * Process monitoring (`top` like)
    * Accessibility features
    * Sniffing oslog which includes both syslog and signposts
* Backup

# Installation

Install the last released version using `pip`:

```shell
python3 -m pip install -U pymobiledevice3
```

Or install the latest version from sources:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:doronz88/pymobiledevice3.git
cd pymobiledevice3
python3 -m pip install -U -e .
```

You can also install auto-completion for all available sub-commands by adding the following into your `~/.zshrc`:

```shell
# python-click<8.0
eval "$(_PYMOBILEDEVICE3_COMPLETE=source_zsh pymobiledevice3)"
# python-click>=8.0
eval "$(_PYMOBILEDEVICE3_COMPLETE=zsh_source pymobiledevice3)"
```

## OpenSSL libraries

Currently, openssl is explicitly required if using on older iOS version (<13).

On macOS:

```shell
brew install openssl
```

On Linux:

```shell
sudo apt install openssl
```

# Usage

The CLI subcommands are divided roughly by the protocol layer used for interacting in the device. For example, all
features derived from the DeveloperDiskImage will be accessible from the `developer`
subcommand. This also means that every feature which isn't there won't require it.

This is the main CLI usage:

```
Usage: python -m pymobiledevice3 [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  activation       activation options
  afc              FileSystem utils
  amfi             amfi options
  apps             application options
  backup2          backup utils
  bonjour          bonjour options
  companion        companion options
  crash            crash report options
  developer        developer options.
  diagnostics      diagnostics options
  lockdown         lockdown options
  mounter          mounter options
  notification     notification options
  pcap             sniff device traffic
  power-assertion  Create a power assertion (wraps...
  processes        processes cli
  profile          profile options
  provision        privision options
  remote           remote options
  restore          restore options
  springboard      springboard options
  syslog           syslog options
  usbmux           usbmuxd options
  webinspector     webinspector options
  version          get installed package version
```

## Python API

You could also import the modules and use the API yourself:

```python
from pymobiledevice3.remote.remote_service_discovery import RemoteServiceDiscoveryService
from pymobiledevice3.lockdown import create_using_usbmux
from pymobiledevice3.services.syslog import SyslogService

# Connecting via usbmuxd
lockdown = create_using_usbmux()
for line in SyslogService(service_provider=lockdown).watch():
    # just print all syslog lines as is
    print(line)

# Or via remoted (iOS>=17)
# First, create a tunnel using:
#     $ sudo pymobiledevice3 remote start-quic-tunnel
# You can of course implement it yourself by copying the same pieces of code from:
#     https://github.com/doronz88/pymobiledevice3/blob/master/pymobiledevice3/cli/remote.py#L68
# Now you can simply connect to the created tunnel's host and port
host = 'fded:c26b:3d2f::1'  # randomized
port = 65177  # randomized
with RemoteServiceDiscoveryService((host, port)) as rsd:
    for line in SyslogService(service_provider=rsd).watch():
        # just print all syslog lines as is
        print(line)
```

## Working with developer tools (iOS >= 17.0)

> **NOTE:** Currently, this is only supported on macOS

Starting at iOS 17.0, Apple introduced the new CoreDevice framework to work with iOS devices. This framework relies on
the [RemoteXPC](misc/RemoteXPC.md) protocol. In order to communicate with the developer services you'll be required to
first create [trusted tunnel](misc/RemoteXPC.md#trusted-tunnel) as follows:

```shell
sudo python3 -m pymobiledevice3 remote start-quic-tunnel
```

The root permissions are required since this will create a new TUN/TAP device which is a high privilege operation.
The output should be something similar to:

```
Interface: utun6
RSD Address: fd7b:e5b:6f53::1
RSD Port: 64337
Use the follow connection option:
--rsd fd7b:e5b:6f53::1 64337
```

Now, (almost) all of pymobiledevice3 accept an additional `--rsd` option for connecting to the service over this new
tunnel. You can now try to execute any of them as follows:

```shell
# Accessing the DVT services
python3 -m pymobiledevice3 developer dvt ls / --rsd fd7b:e5b:6f53::1 64337

# Or any of the "normal" ones
python3 -m pymobiledevice3 syslog live --rsd fd7b:e5b:6f53::1 64337
```

## Tunneld

The Tunneld Server is responsible for automatically creating a QUIC tunnel for Remote Service Discovery (RSD) when a
device is connected.

### Command Usage

To start the Tunneld Server, use the following command (with root privileges):

```bash
sudo python3 -m pymobiledevice3 remote tunneld
```

### Using Tunneld

Once the Tunneld Server is running, you can use it for RSD over the created QUIC tunnel.

To specify a device by its UDID:

```bash
python3 -m pymobiledevice3 remote rsd-info --tunnel UDID
```

To let Tunneld automatically select a device (if only one is connected):

```bash
python3 -m pymobiledevice3 remote rsd-info --tunnel ''
```

If no UDID is specified and multiple devices are connected, a prompt will appear for device selection.

## Example

A recorded example for using a variety of features can be viewed at:

    * The following will assume the DeveloperDiskImage is already mounted:
        * Simulate an `x y` location:
            * `pymobiledevice3 developer simulate-location set x y`
            * Or the following for iOS>=17.0:

        * Sniff all KDebug events into a file for parsing later with tools such
          as [`pykdebugparser`](https://github.com/matan1008/pykdebugparser), `fs_usage` and so on...
            * `pymobiledevice3 developer dvt core-profile-session save FILENAME`
        * Get device extended information (kernel name, chipset, etc...):
            * `pymobiledevice3 developer dvt device-information`
        * Monitor energy-consumption for a specific PID:

### Sending your own messages

#### Lockdown messages

Every such subcommand may wrap several relay requests underneath. If you wish to try and play with some the relays
yourself, you can run:

```shell
pymobiledevice3 lockdown service <service-name>
```

This will start an IPython shell where you already have the connection established using the `client` variable and you
can send & receive messages.

```python
# This shell allows you to communicate directly with every service layer behind the lockdownd daemon.

# For example, you can do the following:
client.send_plist({"Command": "DoSomething"})

# and view the reply
print(client.recv_plist())

# or just send raw message
client.sendall(b"hello")

# and view the result
print(client.recvall(20))
```

#### Instruments messages

If you want to play with `DTServiceHub` which lies behind the `developer` options, you can also use:

```shell
pymobiledevice3 developer shell
```

To also get an IPython shell, which lets you call ObjC methods from the exported objects in the instruments' namespace
like so:

```python
# This shell allows you to send messages to the DVTSecureSocketProxy and receive answers easily.
# Generally speaking, each channel represents a group of actions.
# Calling actions is done using a selector and auxiliary (parameters).
# Receiving answers is done by getting a return value and seldom auxiliary (private / extra parameters).
# To see the available channels, type the following:
developer.supported_identifiers

# In order to send messages, you need to create a channel:
channel = developer.make_channel('com.apple.instruments.server.services.deviceinfo')

# After creating the channel you can call allowed selectors:
channel.runningProcesses()

# If an answer is expected, you can receive it using the receive method:
processes = channel.receive_plist()

# Sometimes the selector requires parameters, You can add them using MessageAux. For example lets kill a process:
channel = developer.make_channel('com.apple.instruments.server.services.processcontrol')
args = MessageAux().append_obj(80)  # This will kill pid 80
channel.killPid_(args, expects_reply=False)  # Killing a process doesn't require an answer.

# In some rare cases, you might want to receive the auxiliary and the selector return value.
# For that cases you can use the recv_plist method.
return_value, auxiliary = developer.recv_plist()
```
